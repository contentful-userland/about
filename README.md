# about contentful-userland

This is an organization for projects in the [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) that meet the following criteria:

* Want to use http://openopensource.org/ governance
* Would benefit from having neutral ownership (e.g. anyone can become a maintainer)
* Provide a generally useful function to the contentful community
* Were considered to be useful in the [module request discussion repo](https://github.com/contentful-userland/module-requests)
* Would otherwise not be maintained effectively

The last point is important. Modules that have no existing maintenance issues should probably not get transferred to this organization.

For modules that have grown beyond the scope their original creators intended this organization provides a governance structure and neutral ownership model to help modules get new contributors and maintainers.

This project adheres to the [Contentful Community code of conduct](https://github.com/contentful-developer-relations/community-code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
